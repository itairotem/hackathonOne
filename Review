### Tic Tac Toe Project Review

#### Overview
Yalls Tic Tac Toe project is a well-structured application that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer a classic game with a modern web interface. Your project includes scoreboard that you didnt quite get to work, but i believe you can do it.

#### Highlights
- **Gameplay Implementation**: The core Tic Tac Toe gameplay is effectively implemented, allowing for intuitive and engaging user interaction.
- **Styling**: The CSS styling provides a pleasant visual experience, with a coherent color scheme and responsive design elements.

#### Areas for Improvement
- **Responsive Design**: While the design is visually appealing, further improvements can be made for better responsiveness on various devices. Consider using more relative units (`vw`, `vh`, `%`) and media queries.
- **Code Optimization**: The JavaScript code, particularly in the `TicTacToe` class, could be optimized for readability and efficiency. For example, the `makeMove` method could be streamlined to reduce complexity.
- **Accessibility**: Enhancing accessibility by adding keyboard navigation and ARIA roles would make the game more inclusive.
- **Documentation**: Adding comments to the JavaScript code would improve maintainability and readability, making it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand the code's logic.

#### Suggested Code Improvement
Consider refactoring the `makeMove` method to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. For example, you could separate the win and tie checks into their own methods.

#### Conclusion
This Tic Tac Toe project is a solid demonstration of your web development skills, with a focus on user interaction and visual design. By addressing the areas for improvement you can further enhance the project's quality and user experience.
Great job guys!
